# üìà Stock Market Price Prediction Web Application
Welcome to the Stock Market Price Prediction platform ‚Äî a dynamic web application that predicts stock prices using multiple machine learning models and real-time data.

## ‚ú® Key Features:
- **Real-Time Stock Prediction:** Focused on AAPL (Apple Inc.) using live market data.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of different ML models like Linear Regression, LSTM, ARIMA, and more.
- **Spin Wheel for Random Model Selection:** Adds an interactive and fun way to pick a model for prediction.
- **Live Price Tracking:** Displays real-time stock prices and updates dynamically.
- **Prediction Graphs:** Visualize predictions versus actual prices on easy-to-read charts.
- **User-Friendly Frontend:** Intuitive UI for smooth interaction and exploration of models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)

## üéØ Objective:
- To develop a dynamic and interactive web application for stock market price prediction.
- To implement multiple machine learning models like Linear Regression, LSTM, ARIMA for real-time predictions.
- To allow users to compare different model performances visually.
- To provide additional interactive features like Spin Wheel for random model selection and Live Price Tracking.
- To ensure the frontend is user-friendly using React.js and backend APIs are handled through Flask.

## üöÄ Deployment:
- The project has been successfully deployed using **Vercel**, providing fast, reliable, and scalable hosting for the React frontend.
- Vercel ensures smooth client-side rendering, global CDN distribution, and easy continuous deployment directly from GitHub.
